                <h2>Cajun-Stuffed Chicken</h2>
                <p>
                    Cajun seasoning is a top 5 go-to seasoning mix for our Test 
                    Kitchen chefs. We love the spicy, zesty flavors it can 
                    provide to everything it touches. The spice also makes this 
                    stuffed chicken dish a perfect leftover contender because 
                    the flavor last and lasts.

                <p>
                    We can thank the cuisine of Tex-Mex for the origin of the 
                    classic fajita. These days you can find steak, chicken, 
                    shrimp, or even vegetarian fajitas, so go wild! Whatever you
                    choose, minimal prep, cook time, and ingredients means these 
                    can be on your dining room table FAST.

                <h2>Beef Stew</h2>
                <p>
                    Beef stew is a comfort food essential. It's a perfect meal 
                    all on its own, but we also love beef stew served over some 
                    al dente egg noodles. Want something a little heartier? Try 
                    ladling a bit of stew over some garlic mash.

                <p>
                    Chef Millie Peartree's baked mac & cheese is famous for many 
                    reasons, the top of which is that she puts an ENTIRE layer 
                    of extra cheese in between two layers of (already cheesy) 
                    macaroni. Game. Changer.

                <p>
                    If you're looking for a super-simple, comforting, no-frills 
                    bowl of spaghetti and meatballs, you've come to the right 
                    place. And if you're feeling adventurous, it's also a great 
                    jumping-off point to make your own version of this classic

                <h2>Chicken & Waffles</h2>
                <p>
                    Making fried chicken and waffles at the same time is quite a 
                    feat, but this soul food classic is worth the effort. We 
                    think the best course of action is to get your chicken in a 
                    buttermilk brine, whip up your waffles and pop 'em in a 200° 
                    oven to stay warm. THEN take out your chicken, bread, and 
                    fry.

                <h2>Tater Tot Casserole</h2>
                <p>
                    This casserole is a total guilty pleasure. If you're trying 
                    to lighten it up, ground turkey or chicken would be a 
                    delicious swap out for the beef. If green veggies are more 
                    your thing (we're impressed!), top the casserole with 
                    zucchini tater tots in place of the potato variety.

                <h2>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</h2>
                <p>
                    You know what’s great? Mashed potatoes. You know what’s even 
                    better? Roasted garlic mashed potatoes! That extra-savory 
                    flavor from melty, roasted garlic adds the perfect kick to 
                    classic mashed spuds. (We also add a splash of tangy 
                    balsamic vinegar to kick them up a notch.)

                <h2>Chicken 'n Waffles Casserole</h2>
                <p>
                    Southern chicken & waffles are the BEST, but getting 
                    everything out at the same time can be tricky. When you need 
                    to feed a crowd quick, use our freezer waffle and breaded 
                    chicken hack instead!
