                <p>
                    Falcons are birds of prey in the genus Falco, which includes
                    about 40 species. Some small species of falcons with long, 
                    narrow wings are called hobbies,[7] and some that hover 
                    while hunting are called kestrels.[7][8] Falcons are widely 
                    distributed on all continents of the world except 
                    Antarctica, though closely related raptors did occur there 
                    in the Eocene.[9]

                <p>
                    Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to 
                    fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. Fledgling 
                    falcons, in their first year of flying, have longer flight 
                    feathers, which make their configuration more like that of 
                    a general-purpose bird such as a broadwing. This makes 
                    flying easier while still learning the aerial skills r
                    equired to be effective hunters like the adults.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae 
                    subfamily of Falconidae, which also includes two other 
                    subfamilies comprising caracaras and a few other species of 
                    "falcons". All these birds kill prey with their beaks, using
                    a tomial "tooth" on the side of their beaks — unlike the 
                    hawks, eagles and other larger birds of prey from the 
                    unrelated family Accipitridae, who use talons on their 
                    feet.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Falcons are roughly divisible into three or four groups. The 
                    first contains the kestrels (probably excepting the American 
                    kestrel);[17] usually small and stocky falcons of mainly 
                    brown upperside colour and sometimes sexually dimorphic; 
                    three African species that are generally gray in colour 
                    stand apart from the typical members of this group. The fox 
                    and greater kestrels can be told apart at first glance by 
                    their tail colours, but not by much else; they might be very 
                    close relatives and are probably much closer to each other 
                    than the lesser and common kestrels. Kestrels feed chiefly 
                    on terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of appropriate 
                    size, such as rodents, reptiles, or insects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second group contains slightly larger (on average) 
                    species, the hobbies and relatives. These birds are 
                    characterized by considerable amounts of dark slate-gray in 
                    their plumage; their malar areas are nearly always black. 
                    They feed mainly on smaller birds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third are the peregrine falcon and its relatives, variably 
                    sized powerful birds that also have a black malar area 
                    (except some very light color morphs), and often a black 
                    cap, as well. They are very fast birds with a maximum speed 
                    of 390 kilometres per hour. Otherwise, they are somewhat 
                    intermediate between the other groups, being chiefly medium 
                    grey with some lighter or brownish colours on their upper 
                    sides. They are, on average, more delicately patterned than 
                    the hobbies and, if the hierofalcons are excluded (see 
                    below), this group typically contains species with 
                    horizontal barring on their undersides. As opposed to the 
                    other groups, where tail colour varies much in general but 
                    little according to evolutionary relatedness,[note 1] the 
                    tails of the large falcons are quite uniformly dark grey 
                    with inconspicuous black banding and small, white tips, 
                    though this is probably plesiomorphic. These large Falco 
                    species feed on mid-sized birds and terrestrial vertebrates.

                <h1>Taxonomy</h1>
                <p>
                    The genus Falco was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish 
                    naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema
                    Naturae.[13] The type species is the merlin (Falco 
                    columbarius).[14] The genus name Falco is Late Latin meaning
                    a "falcon" from falx, falcis, meaning "a sickle", referring 
                    to the claws of the bird.[15][16] In Middle English and Old
                    French, the title faucon refers generically to several 
                    captive raptor species.[17]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The traditional term for a male falcon is tercel (British 
                    spelling) or tiercel (American spelling), from the Latin 
                    tertius (third) because of the belief that only one in three 
                    eggs hatched a male bird. Some sources give the etymology as 
                    deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about one-third 
                    smaller than a female[18][19][20] (Old French: tiercelet). A 
                    falcon chick, especially one reared for falconry, still in 
                    its downy stage, is known as an eyas[21][22] (sometimes 
                    spelled eyass). The word arose by mistaken division of Old 
                    French un niais, from Latin presumed nidiscus (nestling) 
                    from nidus (nest). The technique of hunting with trained 
                    captive birds of prey is known as falconry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compared to other birds of prey, the fossil record of the 
                    falcons is not well distributed in time. For years, the 
                    oldest fossils tentatively assigned to this genus were from 
                    the Late Miocene, less than 10 million years ago.[23] This 
                    coincides with a period in which many modern genera of birds 
                    became recognizable in the fossil record. As of 2021, the 
                    oldest falconid fossil is estimated to be 55 million years 
                    old.[24][25] Given the distribution of fossil and living 
                    Falco taxa, falcons are probably of North American, African, 
                    or possibly Middle Eastern or European origin. Falcons are 
                    not closely related to other birds of prey, and their 
                    nearest relatives are parrots and songbirds.[26]

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Very similar to these, and sometimes included therein, are 
                    the four or so species of hierofalcon (literally, 
                    "hawk-falcons"). They represent taxa with, usually, more 
                    phaeomelanins, which impart reddish or brown colors, and 
                    generally more strongly patterned plumage reminiscent of 
                    hawks. Their undersides have a lengthwise pattern of 
                    blotches, lines, or arrowhead marks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While these three or four groups, loosely circumscribed, are 
                    an informal arrangement, they probably contain several 
                    distinct clades in their entirety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A study of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data of some 
                    kestrels[17] identified a clade containing the common 
                    kestrel and related "malar-striped" species, to the 
                    exclusion of such taxa as the greater kestrel (which lacks a 
                    malar stripe), the lesser kestrel (which is very similar to 
                    the common, but also has no malar stripe), and the American 
                    kestrel, which has a malar stripe, but its colour pattern – 
                    apart from the brownish back – and also the black feathers 
                    behind the ear, which never occur in the true kestrels, are 
                    more reminiscent of some hobbies. The malar-striped kestrels 
                    apparently split from their relatives in the Gelasian, 
                    roughly 2.0–2.5 million years ago (Mya), and are seemingly 
                    of tropical East African origin. The entire "true kestrel" 
                    group—excluding the American species—is probably a distinct 
                    and quite young clade, as also suggested by their numerous 
                    apomorphies.
