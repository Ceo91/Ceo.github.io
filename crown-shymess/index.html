            <b>Crown Shymess</b>(also 
            <i>canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]</sup>
            <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sub>[2]</sub> or 
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i> <sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed 
            in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do 
            not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.
            <sup>[4][5]</sup> The 
            phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but 
            also occurs between trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
            There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive 
            behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of 
            leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>
